## Summary

**Note: this project is in very primordial state, also I'm not a web developer, so probably a lot of things are wrong. Any feedback is welcome :-)**

This is a RaspberryPi based web sever for storage and visualization of data from various sensors that I made:
* [Gamma Spectrometer](https://github.com/RobertGawron/GammaSpectrometer)
* [Ionization Chamber](https://github.com/RobertGawron/IonizationChamber)
* [Semiconductor Radioactivity Detector](https://github.com/RobertGawron/SemiconductorRadioactivityDetector)
* [Geiger-Muller Counter](https://github.com/RobertGawron/GeigerMullerCounter)
* Weather Station (home temperature and humidity sensor).

## Setup

* [Setting-up server](./Server/README.md)
* Sensors:
    * TBD
