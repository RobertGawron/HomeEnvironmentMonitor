## Purpose

The **WiFi Devices** directory contains scripts and configurations for gathering data from sensors and devices connected via Wi-Fi. These scripts handle communication with various devices over the network, process the received data, and prepare it for storage in the backend (InfluxDB).

This directory includes:

* **Device-Specific Interfaces**: Scripts for interacting with specific Wi-Fi-enabled devices or sensors.
* **Wi-Fi Connection Management**: Utility scripts to manage the connection to Wi-Fi devices, handle retries, and ensure data is collected reliably.
* **Data Collection**: Logic for receiving, validating, and formatting data from Wi-Fi devices before sending it to the backend.
