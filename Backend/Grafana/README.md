## Purpose

The **Grafana** directory contains configuration files and custom settings for **Grafana**, the visualization tool used in the Home Environment Monitor project. Grafana is responsible for displaying time-series data from sensors and devices via customizable dashboards.

This directory includes:

- **Dashboard Configurations**: Predefined dashboards for visualizing sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, radiation levels).
- **Plugins**: Any additional plugins or integrations used to extend Grafana's functionality.
- **Grafana Configurations**: The main configuration file (`grafana.ini`) to manage Grafana settings such as security, data sources, and user access.
