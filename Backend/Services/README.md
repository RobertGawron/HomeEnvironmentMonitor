# Services

## Purpose

The **Services** directory contains custom backend services responsible for data processing and interfacing between the sensors and storage systems. These services may include:

- **Data Processing**: Clean, aggregate, and format raw sensor data for storage in InfluxDB.
- **Automation**: Scripts to automate tasks such as data backups, sensor polling, and alerting.
- **API Interfacing**: If any custom APIs are used, their logic will be placed here.

These services act as the "glue" between the raw sensor data and the visualization layer (Grafana).
